# Sarcasm and Sentiment Detection
## Overview:
### Sarcasm and Sentiment Analysis is the project targeted towards dealing with Sarcastic comments associated and sentiments associated with them. Our main focus is the Product feedbacks, and to improvising them. We know nowadays, Sarcasm plays an crutial role when it comes to any product/business, interpreting wrong sentiments out of these comments can lead to misconceptions when dealing with product development/analysis/upgradations while genuine reviews stay aside! Well, this this growing sarcastic social world, there should be a need to capture or filter out these sarcastic comments, while keeping only genuine comments for analysis. 
### There comes our project "Sarcasm and Sentiment Detection", where we have tried to tackle this rising issue. We target to not only detect the sarcasms out of the comments, but also capture the sentiments associated with them. Our UI/UX is designed to preoduce the results in a most interactive way possible.
